# 🎓 Voice-Controlled College Assistant System

An integrated AI-driven assistant that combines **speech recognition**, **voice-controlled file access**, and a **college admission chatbot** — all designed to make interaction seamless and hands-free using natural speech.

## 💡 Project Overview

This project unifies three key voice-enabled functionalities into one desktop-based application:

1. **College Admission Chatbot (Voice-Based)**
   A smart assistant to answer queries about college admissions — including courses, eligibility, deadlines, and more — using natural voice interactions.

2. **Speech-to-Text Converter**
   Converts real-time speech input into editable, copyable text. Useful for note-taking, documentation, or dictation.

3. **Voice-Controlled File Explorer**
   Opens files and folders on your computer through spoken commands like “Open resume.pdf” or “Open Documents folder”.

## 🔧 Features

* 🎤 **Real-time Speech Recognition** (using `speech_recognition`)
* 💬 **Natural Language Processing** for chatbot responses (can integrate with GPT or custom rules)
* 🗂 **Voice-activated File Access**
* 📝 **Live Speech-to-Text Display**
* 🎓 **College Admission Domain Knowledge** (custom-trained or rule-based)
* 🖥 **Desktop Application Interface** (using `Tkinter` or `PyQt`)
